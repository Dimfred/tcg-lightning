# 0.1.15

## Features

- Natural language to Scryfall syntax conversion in search

## Bug Fixes

- **Card Tags**: Tags now use `oracle_id` instead of card name for more reliable card identification across different printings
- **Plaintext Parser**: Fixed parsing of double-faced cards (cards with //) and added fallback parsing for cards with malformed data
